# 🌟 **Community Landing Page Contest**  

You’ve probably all seen our current **“Coming Soon”** page — not much information, not very exciting.  
So we decided: **the community gets to redesign it!** 🎉  
Here’s how the event will work:

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

### **1️⃣ Create your own landing page design**
You, the community, can design a **single landing page** that follows the rules listed below.  
Once finished, post your submission in the **#submissions** channel.

### **2️⃣ Community Reaction Voting**
After the submission deadline, everyone can react with a 🔥 to the designs they like.  
The **top 5 designs** with the most flames will move to the next round.

### **3️⃣ Improvement Phase (Top 5)**
The creators of the top 5 designs may **refine, improve, or fix** their submissions.

### **4️⃣ Voting for the Top 3**
Another voting round will determine the **best 3 designs**.  
👉 Each person has **only one vote**.

### **5️⃣ Final Improvement Phase**
The top 3 creators may again **improve their designs**.

### **6️⃣ Final Voting**
A **final vote** will determine the **ultimate winner** 🏆.

## 📏 **Rules**

- Your submission must be **only one page**  
  → A single **Landing Page**.
- All graphics and content must be **created by you**.  
  → No stolen wallpapers, images, or assets!  
  *(Small exceptions are possible — if unsure, just ask.)*

---

## 📤 **Format / Submission**

- Preferably submit your design **as an image**, so everyone can easily view it on Discord.
- With the winner, we will discuss internally how the final delivery should be handled.
- You may also create a **demo website** if you want to showcase effects that can't be explained well in an image.
- If you include **scroll effects or animations**, please also attach a **video** so the effects can be seen clearly.
- you can submit it in <>
